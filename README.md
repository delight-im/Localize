# Localize

**Android Localization Platform for Collaborative Translation of Applications**

A simple platform for collaborative translation of Android applications. It can be used in the web browser, where users may sign up as a translator or developer. Developers may host their own projects and let translators contribute.

You can either use the tool on www.localize.io or download the source and use it as a self-hosted platform.

Developers may review contributions and export a ZIP file containing all translations with just a few clicks. The translations are exported as Android XML resources so they are ready for deployment right away.

Hopefully, this will speed-up the development and localization process for you, especially if you work for a small company or if you are a single developer.

**Live Demo:** www.localize.io

## Configuration

All configuration is done in `config.php` in the root directory.
